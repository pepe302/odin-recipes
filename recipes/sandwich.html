    <h3>Decription:</h3>
        <p>A sandwich is a dish typically consisting variously of meat, cheese, sauces, and vegetables used as a filling between slices of bread, or placed atop a slice of bread; or, more generally, any dish in which bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type, and allows it to be a finger food.[1][2][3] The sandwich began as a portable, convenient food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide.</p>
        <p>There has been social media debate over the precise definition of sandwich, specifically whether a hot dog or open sandwich can be categorized as such. Other items, like hamburgers and burritos, were also considered. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the responsible agencies for protecting the definition of sandwich</p>
